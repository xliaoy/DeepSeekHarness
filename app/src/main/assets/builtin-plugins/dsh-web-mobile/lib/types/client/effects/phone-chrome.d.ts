 *   every host rewrite, node replacement, or late injection, so
 *   env(safe-area-inset-top) stays the real status-bar / notch height
 *   instead of silently going stale when the host touches the meta. No zoom
 *   tokens here: iOS 10+ ignores them for user pinch but other engines
 *   honor them, and the focus-zoom fix is the >=16px field floor (#45), not
 *   a zoom ban. Dispose restores the host's own content as observed at arm
 *   time.
 * - A theme-color meta tracks the shell background (the official theme is
 *   toggled by body[data-ds-dark-theme], which flips --dsw-alias-bg-base):
 *   Android then paints the status bar / URL bar with the page's own base
 *   color, so the status bar reads as part of the UI instead of a foreign
 *   strip. The drawer paints the same strip on iOS / notch displays.
 * - documentElement carries data-mobile-nav-ios on iOS WebKit so the
 *   stylesheet can hold every text field at >=16px and Safari never
 *   focus-zooms the viewport (#45). Double-tap zoom is off through
 *   touch-action; pinch zoom stays available on purpose — it is the only way
 *   back out of a zoom the browser applied on its own.
