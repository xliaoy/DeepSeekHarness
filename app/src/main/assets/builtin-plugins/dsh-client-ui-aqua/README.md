# Notice ⚠️: As DSH has been updated, I am unable to promptly update the plugin with the new APIdue to my academic commitments. Please use an alternative agent to replace or repair it yourself to avoid crashes when installing this plugin.


Aqua is a highly customizable glassmorphism theme for the DeepSeek Harness web UI. The header, sidebar, composer, stats line, and trajectory view all become panes of frosted glass. you can put video for wallpaper and Switch it off and the stock UI comes back exactly, with no source changes to DSH itself.

## Features

- **Two modes**: **Mica** restyles the layout into floating glass cards (blur and frost adjustable), while **Compatibility Mode** keeps the stock layout byte-for-byte and only swaps the material to generic glass — other plugins' UI gets the same treatment automatically
- **Free backdrop**: a living fluid board (hue adjustable) or your own wallpaper (fills the page, aspect preserved, with its own blur and frost); light wallpapers look best in light mode, dark wallpapers in dark mode
- **Background brightness**: follows the resolved scheme — dark mode darkens (0–50), light mode brightens (50–100), 50 is unchanged
- **Particle whale**: the deepseek.com/harness centerpiece fish (a 2D port of the site's particle engine), centered in the chat area right of the sidebar — white particles on dark, gray on light, toggleable in settings
- **Glossy "Harness" badge**: in dark mode the sidebar wordmark wears the official nameplate pill (135° gradient ring + soft glow); light mode keeps the stock plate
- **Edge fades**: 5px gradient blur bands pinned to the top and bottom of the page, above the chat content — scrolling content melts into the edges; faint white veil on light, faint black on dark
- One switch: off restores the stock UI exactly, and every effect is removed with the plugin

## Installation

### Option 1: npm one-liner (recommended)

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-client-ui-aqua
```

Installs the latest version from npm and registers it as a profile plugin layer (`dsh.bundle` patch) — works on every platform. Reload the web UI and it is on.

### Option 2: GitHub installer (fallback)

No npm account and no git needed (falls back to a plain zip download).

**Windows (one command):**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Invoke-WebRequest 'https://github.com/WYH66666666/DSH-Transparent-UI-Plugin/raw/main/install.ps1' -OutFile install.ps1; .\install.ps1"
```

Installs the **latest release** by default. The script links the plugin into the profile's `node_modules` and registers `ui-aqua` in `cordis.patch.yml` (idempotent — safe to run again).

Pin a version or track the dev branch:

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -Version 'v1.1.0'   # a specific release
.\install.ps1 -Version 'main'     # the development branch
```

**macOS / Linux (manual, three steps):**

```sh
git clone --depth 1 --branch v1.1.0 https://github.com/WYH66666666/DSH-Transparent-UI-Plugin.git
ln -s "$PWD/DSH" "$DSH_HOME/profiles/node_modules/@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-aqua"
```

then append to `$DSH_HOME/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: ui-aqua
      name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-aqua'
```

## Usage

Reload the web UI. Aqua is **on by default**; the master switch lives in **Settings → Plugins → Glass theme** (same shape as the other plugin cards), and every other control sits directly under **Settings → General → Appearance** (no title of its own): mode, blur/frost (Mica mode), fluid color, background brightness, backdrop (fluid/wallpaper) with its wallpaper controls, and the particle-whale toggle. With the master switch off, the whole control block under Appearance is hidden.
